									<blockquote>"Picked up my 2 bull terriers yesyerday after their week at Whitebridge. The guys are great and so love dogs which for us means everything. Both, especially Millie, are knackered which means they have had a blast. I love not having to worry about them when we are away but the guys still humour me and post pictures on Facebook. Thank-you "</blockquote>

									<blockquote>"Paul, Becky, Jacqui and all the staff are so friendly and Duke loves it there. He rarely eats when I'm not around and is normally in a hurry to jump in the car to come home. But here is a totally different story, it's becoming his second home with doggy day care and is so much more confident in himself and that's down to the guys here who totally care and love dogs - thank you so much everyone for helping duke get back to his old self, happy and full of himself, will never go anywhere else"</blockquote>

									<blockquote>"Paul, Becky and Jacqui are fabulous, very kind and caring and went out their way to reply to the dozen or so emails I sent as our dog can't be a bit of a handful as she doesn't like strangers. They even sent pictures. All the staff are great at what they do and I shall definitely be using their services again. "</blockquote>
